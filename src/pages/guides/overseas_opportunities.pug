      p.
        NUS Overseas College is a 6-month or 1-year programme where you intern at an overseas/local
        company and take entrepreneurship modules at the same time. The selection process consist of
        3 rounds of interview, but you may proceed straight to the second round if you completed at
        least a Project Gemini for Orbital (Year 1 summer project, information will be make known to
        you in due time). While a good CAP will be beneficial, it does not play as heavy a weightage
        as your interview or portfolio.

      h1#student-exchange-programmes Student Exchange Programmes (SEP)
      p.
        Student Exchange Programme is a programme where instead of studying in NUS, you study in
        another overseas/local partner University for 1 Semester. If you are able to map the modules
        you took in the partner University, it will be considered as you have fulfilled the module
        that you mapped onto. If you are planning to go for SEP, it might be good to plan which
        modules are easily mapped and refrain from taking them in NUS. Modules taken and mapped will
        only be graded on a pass-fail basis and will not affect your CAP. You may find out all
        available pre-approved modules

      p.
        In the SEP selection process, your CAP plays a vital role. So, if youâ€™re aiming to go SEP
        through computing, it will be good to strive for a good CAP. That said, with the newly
        implemented SoC Student Award System (last tab of guides), participating in various other
        student life events also entitles you to different tiers of this award, which in turns
        boosts your SEP chances. You will be informed through email when calls for application for
        SEP starts.
