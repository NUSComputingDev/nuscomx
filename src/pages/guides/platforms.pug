        Education Records System (EduRec) is a platform for the platform where you access and settle 
        all your administrative matters. You can view your exam schedule and results, view your 
        transcript, apply to map your SEP modules, etc. You would also be able to change your credit 
        debit (where NUS puts and deducts money respectively) bank account details. Click on 
        ‘Academics’ or ‘Financials’ to access these features. ModReg@EduRec is the University’s 
        consolidated module registration platform for all NUS students. It is used for module 
        registration and selection of tutorial/lab slots. Selection of Modules and tutorial/lab slots 
        would only be available during module registration (Academics -> Module Registration).

        LumiNUS is the academic platform you access most often during your semester. After your 
        module is locked in, you will be able to find announcements by your Professors, watch the 
        module's webcasts, view grades for continual assessment, upload assignments and download 
        the module's contents (lecture slides, tutorial sheets, etc.) your Professors upload.

      h1#nusmods NUSMods
      p.
        This is the single module planning website that almost all undergraduates use to plan their
        modules, created by our very own SoC alumni. It is linked with NUS official database, so the
        information should be up to date and accurate (if you want to be sure, do cross check with
        NUS official websites). Here, you can plan your timetable, search for module information
        (the semester it is being offered, its prerequisites and preclusions, its reviews, etc.),
        get a link to share your timetable, and even find venues from the timetable!

      h1#nusync NUSync
      p.
        This is the portal NUS is attempting to slowly migrate to. Various announcements will be
        posted there, but most of the time, it will also be sent to your email. At present, we use
        it mainly for the Exam Welfare Pack Survey at the end of every semester.
