        h1 &#x1F3BE;&#x1F3C0;&#x1F945; IFG FAQs &#x1F3D2;&#x1F3C8;&#x1F3F8;&#x1F3AE;
        br
        p 1: What is IFG?
        br
        p
          | IFG refers to Inter Faculty Games that runs from mid July to mid August, whereby students from each faculty get to compete against one another in various sports.
          | It is NOT Inter-Hall Games (IHG) and the commitment ends in the first few weeks of school so no worries about it affecting school or IHG.
        span -----
        br
        p 2: Do I need experience to participate in IFG?
        br
        p
          | No! You simply have to join the telegram/WhatsApp chat groups of the sports you are interested in and attend trainings to learn, improve and make new friends!
          | Cutting of teams only take place nearer competition dates (subject to each captainâ€™s discretion), so you can definitely join to experience the sport and you just might get chosen to represent the faculty for the sport!
        span -----
        br
        p 3: What is the commitment for IFG like?
        br
        p
          | Each sport has about 1-2 trainings per week and theyâ€™re mostly optional! Of course, higher commitment from you will mean higher chances of getting chosen for the team.
          | New IFG teams are chosen every AY, so joining a sport now does not mean you have to stick with it for your entire candidature (unless you really want to!) You can try new sports every AY even &#x1F60A;&#x1F609;
        br
        span -----
        br
        p 4: Iâ€™m not sure which sports I should join, how can I decide?
        br
        p
          | Just join the sports you are interested in, attend a training or two, if you find that you like it you can stay, otherwise you are also free to leave the group (no pressure!)
        span -----
        br
        p 5: Iâ€™m a female, will it be harder for me to get into the team in mixed gender games?
        br
        p
          | Most definitely not! Each mixed gender sport has a minimum gender ratio so girls are very welcomed! (especially here in computing!! pleasee join IFG!)
        span -----
        br
        p Hope we have cleared up some misconceptions about IFG! Join us at IFG now!
        p We hope to see you around! &#x26BD;&#x1F3AE;&#x1F3C0;&#x1F44A;
